remark: This file is a subset of IDO adequate for indexing using the OLS service. It does not include all logical assertions present in the OWL file, which can be obtained at http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ido/2010-12-02/ido-base.owl

remark: The core Infectious Disease Ontology is an ontology of entities generally relevant to both the biomedical and clinical aspects of infectious diseases, including terms such as 'pathogen', 'host', 'vector', and 'vaccine'.  The structure of IDO adheres to the Basic Formal Ontology.  Terms in IDO that are within the scope of other OBO Foundry ontologies, such as the Gene Ontology, are derived from those ontologies.  Other terms are defined as cross-products of terms from Foundry ontologies to the extent possible. For more information, see http://www.infectiousdiseaseontology.org/Home.html.

The various forms of symbiosis include parasitism\, in which the association is disadvantageous or destructive to one of the organisms; mutualism\, in which the association is advantageous\, or often necessary to one or both and not harmful to either; and commensalism\, in which one member of the association benefits while the other is not affected. However\, mutualism\, parasitism\, and commensalism are often not discrete categories of interactions and should rather be perceived as a continuum of interaction ranging from parasitism to mutualism.
